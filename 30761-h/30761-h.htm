<h1><b><span class="sp1">THE MINUS WOMAN</span></b></h1>

<h2><i>By<br />
Russ Winterbotham</i></h2>

<div class="bk1"><p><big><b>What made the mass of this
tiny asteroid fluctuate in defiance
of all known physical
laws? It was an impossible
fact&mdash;but then, so was the girl
who they knew couldn't exist!</b></big></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Red Brewer</span> had plugged
his electric razor into the lab
circuit and he was running it
over his pink jowls while I tried to
discover what was haywire about
the balance scales.</p>

<p>"Have you noticed," Red said
above the clatter of his shaver,
"how much less you have to shave
on an asteroid?"</p>

<p>"I still shave every day," I said.
There was something definitely
wrong with the scales. The ten-gram
weight didn't balance two
five-gram weights. Instead it
weighed 7.5 grams. And then,
suddenly, the cockeyed scales
would get ornery and the two five-gram
weights would weigh 7.5
grams and the ten-gram slug
would weigh what it should.</p>

<p>"I don't," said Red. "I shave
once a week. Back on terra I
shaved every day, but not here.
And I don't even have a beard
to show for it."</p>

<p>I didn't answer. There were
tougher problems on my mind than
whiskers, but of course Red Brewer
wouldn't understand them. He
was good at machinery, and with
a camera, and for company on a
lonely asteroid which right now
was 300,000,000 miles from the
earth, but he certainly wasn't a
brain.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it, Jay?"
he asked. "Oh, Mr. Hayling, I'm
speaking to you."</p>

<p>"Maybe it's your thyroid," I
said. "Shut up."</p>

<p>"I'm twenty-seven," said Red.
"Too old to have thyroids."</p>

<p>"You mean adenoids."</p>

<p>Red growled and shut off the
razor. He ran his hand over his
face. "I've got a face like a
school-kid's," he said. "If there
was only a girl on this god-forsaken
piece of rock to see it."</p>

<p>There were no girls on Asteroid
57GM. This place didn't have
anything excepting a lonely shack
with paper-thin walls made of special
heat-insulating material. There
wasn't a blade of grass; not a
puff of wind; no soil for violets;
not even a symmetrical shape, it
was lopsided like a beaten-up baseball.
Or at least that was what I
thought until something happened
to the balance scales.</p>

<p>The idea of sending Jay Hayling,
which is me, and ruddy Red Brewer
to Asteroid 57GM, was simply
to check up on some figures which
said that this little 10-mile chunk
of rock didn't have the right mass.
Twice it had been clocked on near
passages to Jupiter and twice it
had behaved differently, as if it
had suddenly lost some of its mass.
So Red and I had been sentenced to
fifteen months alone in space on
an asteroid just to find out that
somebody had made a mistake in
arithmetic.</p>

<p>The sonar equipment showed
what kind of rock it was&mdash;iron and
basalt. And I'd made borings
which checked. We'd tested the
speed of escape which was a good
push so we had to be careful, and
its force of gravity, which wasn't
much. And then I'd discovered
that the balance in the lab had a
habit of being 25 per cent wrong
one way or the other every time
I tried to use it.</p>

<p>Red put away his razor and
went through the little door leading
to the living quarters. The
partition was crystal clear plastic
so I could see him pulling himself
along by the hand rail toward the
bookcase. I knew he would presently
find himself something to
read while I worked.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">We</span> seldom walked in the laboratory.
Our muscles, conditioned
by terrestrial gravity,
were too strong for walking. We'd
have bumped our heads on the
ceiling at every step and possibly
we might even have punched a hole
in the roof, losing our air. So we
sort of pulled ourselves along by
a system of hand rails on all of
the anchored desks, furniture and
walls. It was like pulling yourself
along the bottom of the ocean
by hanging onto rocks, since the
air in the lab was dense enough
to support our almost weightless
bodies.</p>

<p>I checked the scales every way
I could and finally gave up. I'd
tackle the problem again tomorrow.
Maybe something on the asteroid,
some magnetic rock or something,
threw it off. I washed my
hands in the laboratory sink and
then, while I wiped them on a towel,
glanced at Red, who was lying on
his bunk reading. For the first
time I noticed how skinny he was
getting. Lack of exercise, I presumed.
We were going to have to
do something to build up our muscles
again. I supposed I had lost
weight just as much as he had.
It would be tough to weigh ourselves
here, since we had only the
balance in the laboratory. Spring
scales wouldn't work on the asteroid&mdash;we
wouldn't have weighed
enough to register, even though
our mass was probably about the
same as an average man's on earth.</p>

<p>Red put the book aside, closed
his eyes and smiled. My eyes
fell on the book for some reason.
Then suddenly I saw a page flip
over. I didn't realize at first that
this couldn't happen.</p>

<p>There wasn't any draft in the
place, I was sure of that. A draft
would mean a leak in the laboratory
and alarms would tell us
when that happened. There was
no motion, nothing to cause a page
in the book to turn.</p>

<p>Another page turned and I was
sure I wasn't dreaming. I pulled
myself over to the door, opened it
a trifle.</p>

<p>"Red!" I called softly.</p>

<p>"Dollie!" He was dreaming.
Dollie was one of the dozen or so
girls he was always talking about
in his sleep.</p>

<p>I pulled myself to his side and
punched him gently. Red woke
up. "You're a hell of a guy," he
said.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "You were dreaming
about Dollie. But I saw something
happen here and I wanted
you to see it too." I pointed at
the book. The pages were still
now. Suddenly one of them flipped
over.</p>

<p>"Somebody, or something is
reading your book," I said.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">We</span> didn't figure it out then
and I wasn't even sure that
I'd made the right diagnosis, but
things went on every day afterwards
that left me convinced there
was something else living on this
hunk of rock besides Red and me.
It didn't have mass, apparently,
because we tried our best to touch
it.</p>

<p>Once when it got to fooling
around with the laboratory balance,
Red and I encircled the balance
with our arms and then
squeezed together without feeling
a thing.</p>

<p>It wasn't energy, because we
tried every instrument to detect
electricity, heat, light, and radio.
But it was alive, because it moved.
It read books and monkeyed with
the lab scales.</p>

<p>And at last I decided that maybe
<i>it</i> had something to do with the
apparent discrepancy in the asteroid's
change in mass. After that
I had a great deal to work on.</p>

<p>Red began behaving queerly
too. He swore that he was getting
too small for his clothing. His shoes,
he said, were almost a size too
large. I was too busy to check,
so I put it down as a loss in
weight.</p>

<p>We'd spent a year on the asteroid
when we were due to pass
Mars. So our first anniversary
was spent in checking our movements
with a telescope, a camera
and a chronometer. We discovered
our mass&mdash;or that of Asteroid
57GM&mdash;had depreciated another
25 per cent. It now had only half
the mass it was supposed to have.
This was too much of an error
for even a grade school student.</p>

<p>"I'll bet some astronomers back
on earth will get redder than my
hair when we get home," Red said.</p>

<p>I shook my head. "It hasn't
anything to do with their observations,"
I said. "It's what is
happening now to you and me.
We're losing mass someway."</p>

<p>There was only one way to
check it and that was to weigh
ourselves. So I rigged up a rude
sort of a balance by weighing out
chunks of rock until we had a mass
equal to what we should weigh,
placing them on a teeter-totter arrangement
I rigged up in the lab.</p>

<p>"It'll be close enough to learn
if we've lost half our mass," I
said.</p>

<p>Red showed a weight loss equal
to about 20 pounds on earth. I
had gained a little weight. These
figures were only relative, and dependent
on whether or not the
rocks we'd used on the balance had
lost mass also. But something was
wrong with Red and I decided to
watch him carefully.</p>

<p>"Your scales are cockeyed," Red
said. "I feel fine. Never felt
better, in fact. Except that I'm
lonesome ... not that I don't enjoy
your company, pal, ole pal,
but I'd like Dollie's better."</p>

<p>Something on the far side of the
room caught my eye. It was along
the glass partition between the lab
and the living room. It might have
been a reflection of some sort, because
the sun was up and its beams
were coming right through the
transparent roof at that moment.
But for a fleeting instant I thought
I saw a figure there. A tall,
shapely, black-haired girl, dressed
in a flowing robe of orange. The
next instant she was gone.</p>

<p>I said I thought it might be a
reflection, but I was pretty sure it
wasn't. "Red," I said. "We've
got company."</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure of it, Red. There's
somebody else here besides us."</p>

<p>"There's no one else. You're
crazy." Red looked around the
room. Then he looked at me.
His gaze was sharp and penetrating.</p>

<p>"You can't see it now," I said.
"But I'm sure I saw something. A
woman. Over there." I pointed
to where I'd seen the thing that
might have been a reflection.</p>

<p>"Maybe you'd better lie down,
Jay. You've been working too
hard. A year out on this rock
could make a man see King Solomon's
harem."</p>

<p>"No, Red," I said. "Those funny
things we saw, your book pages
turning; the cockeyed balance;
maybe your loss of weight. They
aren't natural. Something is here
and what I just saw makes me
think it's human and it's trying
to get in touch with us."</p>

<p>Red's stomach muscles squeezed
with laughter and he held onto
a guard rail to keep from being
sent across the room by the exertion.</p>

<p>"What I saw was a woman,
Red," I went on.</p>

<p>Red laughed out loud and hung
on again. "I could use a babe,"
he said. Suddenly he jerked. "Who
hit me?" he asked. Across his
face was a red welt, the shape of
a woman's hand.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">We</span> called them "manifestations"
after that and Red
called her his ghost sweetheart, although
the slap had convinced him
it wasn't a ghost. Red's getting
slapped was the first indication
that perhaps this thing did have
matter of some sort, but its ability
to remain invisible made it appear
that the matter wasn't the ordinary
kind.</p>

<p>Finally I came up with some
sort of an answer. It was just a
crazy idea and there was no way
to prove that I was right. I tried
to explain it to Red, who didn't
know much about atomic physics,
but he seemed to get the idea.</p>

<p>"You see, Red, it could be
<i>negative</i> matter," I explained.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Well, you know what an electron
is, I suppose, a negatively
charged sub-atomic particle?"</p>

<p>Red nodded.</p>

<p>"And a proton, which is positively
charged?"</p>

<p>Again he nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, scientists have learned
that there could be positive electrons,
as well as negative, and negative
protons. In other words
each sub-atomic particle has a
'minus quantity' counterpart."</p>

<p>"You're saying it, I'm believing
it," said Red. "A guy's gotta believe
something."</p>

<p>"Well, this leads to a great deal
of speculation. If these minus
quantities got together they might
form a minus matter."</p>

<p>"You've got me in a hole, so I'm
minus too."</p>

<p>"You don't have to understand
it, but try to imagine that two
universes could exist side by side,
one minus, one plus, and that neither
could be aware of the other.
Every star, every planet and every
speck of matter could have its
counterpart, but neither would be
aware of that counterpart's existence."</p>

<p>Red grinned and shook his head.
"Crazy," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, crazy. But dig this, supposing
that some sixth sense made
it possible for one of our minus
counterparts to get in contact
with us through extra-sensory perception."</p>

<p>"How'd they do it?" Red asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know. We don't know
how to do it, but it may be that
our scientific progress wouldn't keep
abreast of each other. We might
know more than our minus counterparts
in some fields, and they
might know more in others. But
their special knowledge enabled
them to bridge the gap briefly&mdash;long
enough to see us, and watch
us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And read our books." Red
nodded.</p>

<p>"And perhaps learn our language&mdash;remember
you got slapped."</p>

<p>"I'll watch it," said Red.</p>

<p>"There's no reason why the gap
couldn't be bridged. Science and
minds have done a lot of things that
looked impossible."</p>

<p>We went to bed on that and
all night long I dreamed of negative
universes, with suns like old
Sol except that they shone black
in bright heavens and planets of
space floating in vacuums of matter.
Red must have dreamed about
it too, because he had a question
over the dehydrated ham and eggs
the next morning.</p>

<p>"Does that explain the loss in
mass for this asteroid?"</p>

<p>"I think it does. Either the
method our minus counterparts
have in bridging the gap, or perhaps
some sort of space warp that
permits them to do it. At any
rate enough of the minus world has
been projected through to our side
of the equation to displace the mass
of this planetoid. Our lab scales being
haywire might be the result of
a being's nearness to it, or something."</p>

<p>Red didn't digest it all, but I
could see he was thinking. "I
wonder what all this has to do with
my whiskers," he mused.</p>

<p>We were busy making some
further checks on the planetoid's
mass later in the day when Red got
a glimpse of the vision I'd seen.
Red didn't take it quietly. He
yelled loud and pointed.</p>

<p>I turned just in time to see her
fade away. It was the same woman,
dressed the same. But this
time she had been a bit more than
a vapor.</p>

<p>Red forgot where he was and
made a dive toward her. His body
shot like a bullet across the room,
skimming over laboratory equipment,
and his head crashed solidly
against the telescope.</p>

<p>Red literally bounced back halfway
again. Then a long thin arm
seemed to reach out of nowhere
and seize him by the jacket and
hold him long enough to stop him.</p>

<p>Red drifted down to the floor,
knocked cold.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It</span> had happened so swiftly that
I hadn't had time to move.
Now I pulled myself toward Red.
The arm was still there in space,
and it had added a shoulder, a
rather pretty shoulder. Next there
was a body, clothed in the flowing
orange cape, and finally a woman's
head. It was the same one&mdash;the
minus woman.</p>

<p>"It's true," I said.</p>

<p>The woman seemed to understand.
"Yes," she said. "All that
you told Red Brewer is true, Jay
Hayling. For you, I am a minus
woman. For me, you are a minus
man. But we have bridged the
gap. For the first time in eternity,
plus and minus, positive and negative,
can meet on even terms."</p>

<p>"Better not come too close," I
said.</p>

<p>"Nothing will happen," she replied.
"We are now alike." She
stooped toward the fallen figure
on the floor. "Help me with this
child. He's unconscious."</p>

<p>"Child!" I said. "If he's a
child, they grow 'em big in the
minus world."</p>

<p>But as I lifted Jay off the floor
I wondered if he was as big as
I'd always thought. It wasn't his
weight. Nothing weighed very
much on this asteroid, but it was
his frail body. He seemed to be
a boy of sixteen, rather than a
man stationed 300,000,000 miles
in space.</p>

<p>I carried him out of the laboratory
into the living quarters and
placed him on his bunk. I loosened
his clothing, noting at the time
that he had been right about his
garments not fitting him.</p>

<p>"You've made him lose weight,"
I said.</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?"
the woman asked.</p>

<p>"Because every screwy thing
that has happened since we came
here a year ago must have an explanation."</p>

<p>The woman smiled. "Don't
think too harshly of me." She
looked very solid now. Her body
had lost that tenuous look. She
was no longer nebulous and cloud-like.
"Certain things were necessary
in order for me to proceed
safely through the gap between the
positive and negative worlds," she
explained.</p>

<p>I looked at Red again. His face
was smooth and I knew he hadn't
shaved in more than a week.
"You've made him younger," I
said. "Well, he shouldn't kick at
that."</p>

<p>The woman nodded. "I turned
the young man inside out. In a
moment the transition will be complete.
You will be our next entrance
to this universe...."</p>

<p>From Red's bunk came a wail.
A bawl, like a tiny baby. A dying
baby.</p>

<p>Some people die of age. Red
died an infant. As for the minus
woman&mdash;she was murdered on an
asteroid.</p>
